### Tools -

- [x] **SoundMaster** - Independent volume control for every app, play on multiple audio outputs simultaneously, and more! [How to use](https://github.com/legendsayantan/ShizuTools/wiki/SoundMaster)
- [x] **LookBack** - Allows downgrade of apps, without uninstallation. *Does not work on all devices.*
- [x] **UniversalPip** - Enforces Picture-in-Picture mode for all apps, even if they don't allow it. [How to use](https://github.com/legendsayantan/ShizuTools/wiki/UniversalPip).
- [x] **LocalShell** - Manually execute other raw ADB commands.
- [x] **IntentShell** - Allows other apps (Tasker,MacroDroid,etc) to run ADB commands via intent requests. [How to use](https://github.com/legendsayantan/ShizuTools/wiki/IntentShell)
